<div class="smart_article_content"><!-- DIV CONTAINER FOR MAIN ARTICLE CONTENT -->
<div class="post-text"> <p>I have a script named test1.py which is not in a module. It just has code that should execute when the script itself is run. There are no functions, classes, methods, etc. I have another script which runs as a service. I want to call test1.py from the script running as a service.</p> <p>For example:</p> <h3>File test1.py</h3> <pre><code>print &quot;I am a test&quot;
print &quot;see! I do nothing productive.&quot;
</code></pre> <h3>File service.py</h3> <pre><code># Lots of stuff here
test1.py # do whatever is in test1.py
</code></pre> <p>I&apos;m aware of one method which is opening the file, reading the contents, and basically eval&apos;ing it. I&apos;m assuming there&apos;s a better way of doing this. Or at least I hope so.</p> </div>
